## ðŸ’» Usage

**Use the Zoom Chat Commands**:
   - `/summarize lecture` â€“ Summarizes the lecture content.

   - `/generate notes` â€“ Creates detailed lecture notes and saves them to Google Drive.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Currently, a mock transcript is used for demonstrations. In the future, we plan to enable real-time transcript retrieval from Zoom, which will allow the assistant to process live lecture content. This feature is only available with Zoomâ€™s paid accounts and is under development.
